Hey! My name is Kaye and I'm a sofware engineer with a passion for health and wellness. My interest in software started back in 2012, when I decided to major in Computer Science at Ohio State. I had no prior experience with software engineering but decided to take a risk and try something completely new. During my first year as a CS major, I learned how to code and discovered that I was actually pretty good at it ðŸ˜…. 

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked in the manufacturing industry at General Electric and Intralox; healthcare automation at Olive AI; and oil refinement at Marathon Petroleum. My roles have varied from backend engineering, full-stack engineering, project management, and business analysis. Currently, Iâ€™m concentrating on full-stack web development using React and have recently been dabbling in React Native.

Lately, Iâ€™ve started to focus my attention on tech that helps people reach their health goals. Check out my projects page for things Iâ€™m working on at the moment!
